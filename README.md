Some external libraries jquerry are also linked to append the rows etc.
Rows are highlighted by colors defining the past, current and upcoming hours.
The text area allows the user to input the tasks.
The save button with animation, when clicked stores the input in local storage. This means that refreshing or restarting wil not remove the input value.
